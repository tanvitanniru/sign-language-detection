# sign-language-detection

Kinesics is a real-time hand sign recognition system built using TensorFlow, Mediapipe, OpenCV, and NumPy. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms to recognize hand signs efficiently and accurately. The system uses the Mediapipe library in Python, with 10 pre-trained features to track hand landmarks and gestures, making it highly responsive for real-time applications. Designed for easy integration, Kinesics can support communication tools by translating hand signs effectively.
